In numerical analysis, the FTCS (Forward Time Centered Space) method is a finite difference method used for numerically solving the heat equation and similar parabolic partial differential equations.[1] It is a first-order method in time, explicit in time, and is conditionally stable when applied to the heat equation. When used as a method for advection equations, or more generally hyperbolic partial differential equations, it is unstable unless artificial viscosity is included. The abbreviation FTCS was first used by Patrick Roache.
